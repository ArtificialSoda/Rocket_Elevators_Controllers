Classic:


Modern:
    A call button (+ all the floor buttons) where you enter the building where you choose which floor you want to go, then algorithm tells you which column and which elevator to pick
    No call button on each elevator/column
    No floor buttons inside elevators (so you either go to your initial destination or back to floor 1)
