## Rocket Elevators - Elevate Safety, Speed and Style [[FABIEN H. DIMITROV]]

This repo holds the 2nd and 3rd project given by Codeboxx, which were done during week 1 and 2 of Odyssey, respectively.

## What we had to do
### Week 1
In week 1 of Odyssey, our esteemed client ***Rocket Elevators*** had asked us to write 2 algorithms from scratch, for their elevators: one for Residential buildings and one for Commercial buildings. 

Since it was all about creating the logic and not worrying about the small details, the algorithms were both written in easily understandable pseudocode.

These algorithms take care of every single behind-the-scenes elevator functionality you could think of. The innerworkings of an elevator are obviously quite complex, and since most of the functionalities are intertwined with each other, we had to make sure there's no room for any sort of mistakes or ambiguities. Otherwise, the whole thing would break, and therefore be useless.

Some of the functionalities include, but are not limited to: 

 - Organizing the elevator system into batteries, columns and elevators 
 - Moving the elevators up and down
 - Taking and completing elevator requests
 - Etc.

### Week 2
In week 2 of Odyssey, with the logic behind the algorithms now fully created, we were tasked with rewriting our Residential controller's pseudocode into actual code.

We wrote it in 3 different interpreted programming languages: JavaScript, Python, and Ruby. 

***Note: For the JS script, you have to install the [prompt-sync](https://github.com/heapwolf/prompt-sync) Node module if you want the I/O console functionality to work as intended.  `npm install prompt-sync`*

### Week 3
In week 3 of Odyssey, we were tasked with rewriting our Commercial controller's algorithm pseudocode into actual code. 

To do this, we switched over to compiled programming languages this time around. 3 different compiled languages were explored: C#, Go, and Java. 

Both C# and Java were great language choices for this project mainly because of their rich support for OOP and extensive set of add-on features/libraries. The implementation in Go was also a success, but it was initially more difficult to get it to work because of the language's very unique syntax compared to other popular compiled languages.

#### How to interact with the scripts
*Go*: To run the script, simply clone this repo and run the designated .exe file found inside the Go folder. If you edit code, make sure to run `go build` before re-running the executable again.

*C#*: To run the script, simply clone this repo and run the .sln file found inside the C# folder. You should have already installed the Visual Studio 2019 IDE. You can also modify each individual C# class script by playing around inside the solution (.sln) file.

*Java*: To run the script, simply clone this repo and run Program.java on a Java-supported IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

Feel free to play around and modify the scripts!
